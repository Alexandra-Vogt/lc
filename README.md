# LC
## Lunar Calculator

Have you ever wished you had a command line calculator that could do all of your important
lunar arithmetic based accounting?

Well now you can have one with the popular command line utility `lc`. Using `lc` you can
accurately and quickly do lunar addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.

Here is an example of a usual user session:
```
$ lc
> 2 1 +
2
> 2 2 +
2
> 57 19 +
59
> 17 24 *
124
> wtf!
?
> q
?
> h
?
> help
?
> please just let me out
?
> sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /
?
```

As you can see, `lc` has helpful, ed-like error reporting, not overwhelming the user with
error messages while still helpfully flagging errors.
